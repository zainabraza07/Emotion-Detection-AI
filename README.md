# Emotion Detection AI
Emotion Detection AI
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to detect emotions from user-inputted text. By training on labeled emotional datasets, it can classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and more.

Features:
-Predicts emotion based on input sentence
-Trained on a cleaned text-based dataset
-Simple and intuitive interface
-Supports model evaluation and prediction

Requirements:
-Python 3.x
-scikit-learn
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Limitations:
The popular FER2013 dataset (which uses facial images) could not be included in this repository due to its large file size limit on GitHub. You can manually download it from Kaggle and modify the code to work with image-based emotion detection.
